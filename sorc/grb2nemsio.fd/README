Grib2 to nemsio converter

This code converts grib2 files for GFS model output (RAP/NAM planned) to 
nemsio files that can then be read in to chgres. 

Currently the codes supports conversion of GFS3 (1.0-degree) and GFS4 
(0.5-degree) files. Usage is: 

grb2nemsio.x mname analdate ifhr ifhr_end ifhr_freq inpath

mname: Model name, gfs3, gfs4, or ruc_native currently
analydate: Analysis date, YYYYMMDD
ifhr: Forecast hour
ifhr_end: Final forecast hour you wish to convert
ifhr_freq: Forecast hour frequency
inpath: Location of the grb files

Note:

Grib files can have a wide variety of name formats depending on where you
acquire the data. For gfs3/4 files, the code searches for files of format:

gfs_[3/4]_YYYYMMDD_IIII_FFF.grb2

where IIII is the initialization time and FFF is the forecast hour. This 
complies with the naming convention of archived NCEI grb2 files. You can 
either change file names or modify the code to look for different name 
formats.
